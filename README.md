## Introduction

As part of a comprehensive Data Analytics bootcamp project, we wanted to explore the intricate relationship between Financial Performance and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Risks within the realm of US Mutual Funds. Over the course of several weeks, we meticulously analyzed an extensive dataset comprising 23,783 mutual funds spanning the period from 2011 through 2021.

Our primary objective was to gain a deeper understanding of how these two critical aspects, financial performance, and ESG risks, interplay in the context of mutual fund investments. The project encompassed several key stages, each tailored to derive valuable insights and actionable recommendations for investors and stakeholders.

1.Data Collection and Preprocessing: We carefully sourced, curated, and cleaned the mutual fund data to ensure consistency and accuracy, enabling us to build a reliable foundation for analysis.

2.Financial Performance Analysis: Leveraging various financial metrics and performance indicators, we evaluated the historical performance of each mutual fund. This step involved assessing risk-adjusted returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, alpha, beta, and other crucial measures to identify patterns and trends.

3.ESG Risk Assessment: To comprehensively gauge the ESG risks associated with each mutual fund, we utilized ESG ratings and sustainability scores data to quantify the funds' exposure to environmental, social, and governance risks.

4.Finding Trade-offs: Using the financial and ESG risk assessments as a guide, we sought to identify any trade-offs that might exist between the two aspects. We wanted to know if funds with lower ESG risk profiles tended to have better, worse or the same financial performance as the ones with higher ESG profiles.

5. Visualization and Insights: Throughout the project, we utilized powerful data visualization techniques to communicate our findings effectively. Charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards allowed us to present complex relationships in an easily digestible format 

6.Recommendations: As the culmination of our efforts, we formulated evidence-based recommendations for investors. These insights aimed to strike a balance between financial goals and ESG objectives, guiding stakeholders towards more informed investment decisions.
