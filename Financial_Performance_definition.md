## __Risk Profile KPI__

|Alpha|Beta|Sharpe Ratio|
|It takes the volatility (price risk) of a security or fund portfolio and compares its risk-adjusted performance to a benchmark index. The excess return of the investment relative to the return of the benchmark index is its alpha.| the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio, compared to the market as a whole.|The Sharpe ratio tells investors whether an investment's returns are due to wise investment decisions or the result of excess risk.|
| an alpha of -1.0 would indicate an underperformance of 1%. For investors, the higher the alpha the better.|A beta of 1.0 indicates that the investment's price will move in lock-step with the market. A beta of less than 1.0 indicates that the investment will be less volatile than the market. Correspondingly, a beta of more than 1.0 indicates that the investment's price will be more volatile than the market. For example, if a fund portfolio's beta is 1.2, it is theoretically 20% more volatile than the market.| This measurement is useful because while one portfolio or security may generate higher returns than its peers, it is only a good investment if those higher returns do not come with too much additional risk. The greater an investment's Sharpe ratio, the better its risk-adjusted performance.|
