# Our Approach:  
1. Consistent long-term performance rather than short-term gains

2. Selection criteria based on historical Performance according to the Performance Persistence Paradigm: 

Performance Persistence means that the future performance of mutual funds can be predicted through their
past performanceâ€™ that is the past performance of the fund schemes is an indicator of their future
performance.

# Selection criteria for an investment fund

## __1. Risk Profile KPI__ 
|[Link for Source](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/measure-mutual-fund-risk/)| _"Risk is one word, but it is not one number._"Harry Kat, professor of risk management  |  |
|---|---|---|
|Alpha|Beta|Sharpe Ratio|
|It takes the volatility (price risk) of a security or fund portfolio and compares its risk-adjusted performance to a benchmark index. The excess return of the investment relative to the return of the benchmark index is its alpha.| the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio, compared to the market as a whole.|The Sharpe ratio tells investors whether an investment's returns are due to wise investment decisions or the result of excess risk.|
| An alpha of -1.0 would indicate an underperformance of 1%. For investors, the higher the alpha the better.|A beta of 1.0 indicates that the investment's price will move in lock-step with the market. A beta of less than 1.0 indicates that the investment will be less volatile than the market. Correspondingly, a beta of more than 1.0 indicates that the investment's price will be more volatile than the market. For example, if a fund portfolio's beta is 1.2, it is theoretically 20% more volatile than the market.| This measurement is useful because while one portfolio or security may generate higher returns than its peers, it is only a good investment if those higher returns do not come with too much additional risk. The greater an investment's Sharpe ratio, the better its risk-adjusted performance.|
