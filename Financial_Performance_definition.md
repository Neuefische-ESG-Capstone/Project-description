# Our Approach:  
1. Consistent long-term performance rather than short-term gains

2. Selection criteria based on historical Performance according to the Performance Persistence Paradigm: 

Performance Persistence means that the future performance of mutual funds can be predicted through their
past performanceâ€™ that is the past performance of the fund schemes is an indicator of their future
performance.

# Selection criteria for an investment fund

## __1. Risk Profile KPI__

|---|---|---|---|
|KPIs|Alpha|Beta|Sharpe Ratio|
|Definitions| Difference between what I have earned (Actual in %) and what I should earn (Expected benchmark in %) | The volatility or systematic risk of the fund portfolio, compared to the market as a whole|The Sharpe ratio tells investors whether an investment's returns are due to wise investment decisions or the result of excess risk.|
|Interpretations|__*1__. a null alpha means that the actual return = the expected return, __*2__. a positive alpha means that the fund outperforms the market and __*3__. an alpha of -1.0 would indicate an underperformance of 1%. |__*1__. a beta lower than one suggests that a stock is less risky than the market. __*2__. a beta of one suggests that the stock moves in sync with the market,  __*3__. a beta of more than 1.0 indicates that the investment's price will be more volatile than the market. For example, if a fund portfolio's beta is 1.2, it is theoretically 20% more volatile than the market.| This measurement is useful because while one portfolio or security may generate higher returns than its peers, it is only a good investment if those higher returns do not come with too much additional risk. The greater an investment's Sharpe ratio, the better its risk-adjusted performance.|
