1.Year-to-Date (YTD) return is a financial term used to measure the performance of an investment from the beginning of the current calendar year up to the present date. 
It represents the total return earned by an investment over that period. 

Calculation: YTD return is calculated by comparing the current value of an investment to its value at the beginning of the year. The formula for calculating YTD return is:

YTD return = (Current value - Initial value) / Initial value * 100

The result is expressed as a percentage.

2.The 200-day moving average (200 DMA) is a commonly used technical analysis metric in financial markets, including for mutual funds. It measures the average price of a mutual fund over the previous 200 trading days, providing insights into the fund's long-term trend. Here's what you need to know:

Calculation: The 200-day moving average is calculated by adding up the closing prices of a mutual fund over the last 200 trading days and dividing the sum by 200. The resulting value represents the average price of the fund over that time period.

Long-Term Trend Indicator: The 200-day moving average is primarily used to identify the long-term trend of a mutual fund. By smoothing out short-term price fluctuations, it provides a clearer picture of the fund's overall direction. When the fund's current price is above its 200-day moving average, it is often interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating an uptrend. Conversely, if the price is below the 200-day moving average, it may be seen as a bearish signal, suggesting a downtrend.


3.The "week52_high_low_change" metric, which represents the change between a mutual fund's 52-week high and low prices, can be relevant for analyzing a mutual fund's performance and volatility. Here's some information to consider regarding this metric:

Range of Price Movement: The "week52_high_low_change" metric provides insight into the range of prices at which the mutual fund has traded over the past 52 weeks. It calculates the percentage difference between the highest and lowest prices during that period.

Volatility Assessment: A larger "week52_high_low_change" indicates higher price volatility, suggesting that the mutual fund has experienced significant price fluctuations over the past year. This metric can help investors assess the fund's volatility and determine if it aligns with their risk tolerance.
