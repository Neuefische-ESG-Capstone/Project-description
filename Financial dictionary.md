Year-to-Date (YTD) return is a financial term used to measure the performance of an investment from the beginning of the current calendar year up to the present date. 
It represents the total return earned by an investment over that period. 

Calculation: YTD return is calculated by comparing the current value of an investment to its value at the beginning of the year. The formula for calculating YTD return is:

YTD return = (Current value - Initial value) / Initial value * 100

The result is expressed as a percentage.
